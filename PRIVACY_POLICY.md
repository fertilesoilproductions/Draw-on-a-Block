# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: January 20, 2026**

Fertile Soil Productions ("we", "our", "us") operates Draw on a Block ("the App"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information.

## Information We Collect

**Account Information**  
When you sign in with Google, we receive your Google account email address and a unique user ID. This is handled through Google Firebase Authentication.

**Purchase Information**  
When you make in-app purchases, we store records of your purchases (product IDs, timestamps, platform) in our database to provide you access to purchased content across devices. Payment processing is handled by Stripe; we do not store your payment card details.

**Platform Identifiers**  
If you use the Steam version, we store your Steam ID to link your Steam DLC ownership to your account. This prevents duplicate entitlements across multiple accounts.

**Locally Stored Data**  
Your projects, textures, and settings are stored locally on your device. These are not uploaded to our servers unless you explicitly use cloud features.

## What We Don't Collect

We do not use analytics services. We do not track your usage patterns, collect device information, or monitor your behavior within the App.

## How We Use Your Information

- To provide and maintain your account
- To grant access to purchased content
- To sync entitlements across devices
- To provide customer support

## Third-Party Services

We use the following third-party services:
- **Google Firebase** (Authentication, Database) - [Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)
- **Stripe** (Payment Processing) - [Stripe Privacy Policy](https://stripe.com/privacy)

## Data Retention
